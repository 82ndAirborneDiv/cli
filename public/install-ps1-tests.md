# Test runs for install.ps1 scripts

---

## NOTE

In order to run these tests you must first uninstall the State Tool.
To do this run:

```powershell
Remove-Item (Get-Command state.exe).Source
```

If you installed the State Tool with a different binary name replace 'state.exe' with it.

When the tests are complete run the install script with your preferred configuration
options to reinstall the State Tool.

---

This is a list of tests to manually run after modifying the `install.ps1` file.

## As administrator

First save your path

```powershell
$oldpath = $env:Path
```

### Install as administrator

#### Version A.1: Update path

```powershell
powershell .\public\install.ps1 -t C:\temp\state\bin
```

When prompted to continue after being presented with installation information select `y`.

**What to look for**:

- All messages should be accurate and make sense.
- You should see a warning about running as administrator.
- You should be presented with a message that says: `Please restart your command prompt in order to start using the 'state.exe' program`
- Run

  ```powershell
  [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('Path', [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)
  ```

  to ensure that the path is added to the system path.

#### Cleanup A.1

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force C:\temp\state\bin

$path = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable( 'PATH', [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)
$path = ($path.Split(';') | Where-Object { $_ -ne 'C:\temp\state\bin' }) -join ';'
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('PATH', $path, [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)
```

#### Version A.2: Path is set already

```powershell
$env:Path += ";C:\temp\state\bin"
powershell .\public\install.ps1 -t C:\temp\state\bin
```

When prompted to continue after being presented with installation information select `y`.

**What to look for**:

- All messages should be accurate and make sense.
- You should receive a warning about running as administrator.
- You should be presented with a message that says: `You may now start using the 'state.exe' program`

#### Cleanup A.2

```powershell
$env:Path = $oldpath
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force C:\temp\state\bin
```

### Install and activate as administrator

#### Version A.3.1 Invalid options

```powershell
powershell .\public\install.ps1 -Activate ActiveState/cli -n
```

**What to look for**:

- An error message about incompatible options

#### Version A.3.2 Invalid options 2

```powershell
powershell .\public\install.ps1 -f
```

**What to look for**:

- An error message about `-f`  options

#### Version A.4 Install and Activate

```powershell
powershell .\public\install.ps1 -t C:\temp\state\bin -Activate ActiveState/cli
```

When prompted for the activation directory, type `C:\temp\state`

**What to look for**:

- All messages should be accurate and make sense.
- You should end up in an activated environment.  Ensure that the `state` tool is in the PATH.
- Run

  ```powershell
  [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('Path', [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)
  ```

  to ensure that the path is added to the system path.

#### Cleanup A.4

Ensure that you exit out of your activated session.

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force C:\temp\state

$path = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable( 'PATH', [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)
$path = ($path.Split(';') | Where-Object { $_ -ne 'C:\temp\state\bin' }) -join ';'
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('PATH', $path, [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)
```

#### Version A.5 Install twice

```powershell
.\public\install.ps1 -t C:\temp\state\bin
```

When prompted for installation directory, respond with temporary directory `C:\temp\state\bin`.

Run command again

```powershell
.\public\install.ps1 -t C:\temp\state\bin
```

**What to look for**:

- You should see a warning for running as administrator
- The State Tool artifact should **NOT** be downloaded
- After the second install attempt you should be presented with a message that says:

```powershell
Previous install detected at '<install-dir>'
To update the State Tool to the latest version, please run 'state update'.
To install in a different location, please specify the installation directory with '-t TARGET_DIR'.
```

### Version A.6 Install with force-overwrite

```powershell
.\public\install.ps1 -t C:\temp\state\bin -f -n
```

**What to look for**:

- You should see a warning for running as administrator
- You should see a warning that the State Tool gets overwritten

### Cleanup A.5

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force C:\temp\state

$path = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable( 'PATH', [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)
$path = ($path.Split(';') | Where-Object { $_ -ne 'C:\temp\state\bin' }) -join ';'
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('PATH', $path, [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)
$env:Path = $oldpath
```
